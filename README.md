Each weekly folder contains (at least):
- `data/` - Raw and processed data files used in the lab
- `*.qmd` - Quarto markdown file with lab code and analysis
- `README.md` - Specific information about that week's lab content

## Topics Covered

- **Week 1**: Introduction to map making with `tmap` in R
- Additional weeks to be added as the course progresses

## Tools & Technologies

- **R** - Primary programming language
- **Quarto** - For reproducible documents
- **Key R Packages**:
  - `tmap` - Thematic map visualization
  - `sf` - Simple features for spatial data
  - `terra` - Spatial data analysis
  - Additional packages as needed per lab

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
